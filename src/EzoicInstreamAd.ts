/**
 * An instream video ad controller. Instream video runs inside the host app's
 * OWN video content: **the host owns the video player and the Google IMA SDK**.
 * Unlike the banner/native/outstream views, this controller renders nothing and
 * holds no view — its sole deliverable is a GAM VAST ad-tag URL string the host
 * feeds to its own IMA `AdsRequest`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const instream = new EzoicInstreamAd('12345');
 * const tagUrl = await instream.load({ contentUrl: playingVideoUrl });
 * // hand tagUrl to your IMA AdsLoader / AdsRequest.
 *
 * // On an IMA ad error, walk down the floor waterfall:
 * const next = await instream.getNextAdTagUrl();
 * if (next) { /* request IMA again with next *\/ }
 *
 * // On the IMA STARTED event, record the Ezoic impression:
 * await instream.reportImpression({ revenueUsd: 0.42 });
 *
 * // When finished with the ad unit:
 * await instream.destroy();
 * ```
 *
 * Mirrors the native `EzoicInstreamAd` load pipeline on both platforms. Unlike
 * the interstitial/rewarded ads, the controller is **multi-use** and NOT
 * auto-destroying: the native controller is prefetchable and reused across
 * loads for the same id, so the same instance can be loaded again after a
 * previous load resolves. Call {@link destroy} when the unit is no longer
 * needed. There is no event emitter — every result settles the returned
 * promise directly from the native listener/delegate.
